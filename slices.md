# Slices

A slice is a dynamically sized collection of values.

It is statically typed with `[]<type>` syntax, and can be instantiated as below:

```go
var names = []string { "Frodo", "Bilbo", "Sam" }
```

Values in the slice can be accessed by referencing the variable the slice and using indices.

```go
names[0] // "Frodo"
```
