# HTTP

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and is an _application layer_ protocol and is the foundation for data communication across the World Wide Web.

HTTP/1 was created by Tim Berners-Lee and was fully finalized and documented in 1996, later being updated to HTTP/1.1 in 1997. HTTP/2.0 was released in 2015 with improvements, followed by HTTP/3.0's release in 2022 with lower latency and efficiency.

HTTP acts as a request/response protocol in a client/server system. Requests are sent from client to server with a corresponding response.

The HTTP protocol has many methods, headers and status codes that allow rich communication between entities.
